# 0.1.2.1

* The contents have been merged into network-uri, so the module is now
  empty if you use network-uri. But you can still use this module at the
  latest version if you are requiring the older network-uri for some reason.

# 0.1.1.0

* Added `relativeReference`.

# 0.1.0.0

First release.
